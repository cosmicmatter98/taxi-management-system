# Taxi Management System
Hi! I am Suvradri, and this is my Taxi Management System.

This is a Python project where an individual can run the programme to do any and all of the following:-
1. Book a taxi ride and get a receipt for the ride
2. See existing customers' booking history
3. Add locations before booking
4. Update existing rates
5. Add new taxi rates
6. See all the locations stored in the system as a result of previous taxi rides
